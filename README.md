# Learning Rust 

This repo currently only holds the file called book, this is done in paralel with learning from "the book" of rust, if I feel like I need to write code as to understand better I do, usually project names are very descriptive and I try to get as much info from them.
Also running rustlings in paralel but it's ignored.
